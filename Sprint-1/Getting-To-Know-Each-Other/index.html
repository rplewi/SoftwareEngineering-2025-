		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p style="text-align:left;" class="centeralign">Hi Everyone! This part will be 
			about my life. I was born in <br>Lockport, Illinois and have been going to school 
			in the Lockport area my<br> whole life.
			I have always loved computers and videogames since I was a kid <br>and became 
			interested in the area of computer science. So when  I applied to <br> Lewis I came 
			in as a computer science major. Software engineering will be <br> my first major step into being a software developer!
